Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.\n","\n","**Problem Statement:** Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.\n","\n","**Goal:** Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.\n","\n","**Dataset:** This dataset shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.\n","\n","- Date: Counts of registered vehicles are taken on this day (the end of this month). - 2017-01-31\n","2024-02-29\n","- County: This is the geographic region of a state that a vehicle's owner is listed to reside within. Vehicles registered in Washington\n","- State: This is the geographic region of the country associated with the record. These addresses may be located in other\n","- Vehicle Primary Use: This describes the primary intended use of the vehicle.(Passenger-83%, Truck-17%)\n","- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): The count of vehicles that are known to be propelled solely by an energy derived from an onboard electric battery.\n","- Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): The count of vehicles that are known to be propelled from energy partially sourced from an onboard electric battery\n","- Electric Vehicle (EV) Total: The sum of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).\n","- Non-Electric Vehicle Total: The count of vehicles that are not electric vehicles.\n","- Total Vehicles: All powered vehicles registered in the county.
